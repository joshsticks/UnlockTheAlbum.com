Ideas:
A social network for pay what you want music distribution
Small Indie Bands being the focal point. (of course model works just as well for big)
Think kickstarter, meets pay what you want music(radiohead, NIN etc.), meets humble indie bundle

Band signs up
sets up band page location info, spots for gigs etc. tags etc.
band sets up an album promotion (eg. 8tracks total tier0=3tracks@$0 tier1=3tracks@$2.5k ...2tracks@$5k)
boom
then they can link it out via social networks built in functions etc.

user sees a album, can listen to samples
decides to buy, has to pay maybe $.99 minimum or similar, emailed the current tiers items
if the tier goes up all payed users get emailed that tier's items (eg. when it hits $2.5k the next songs)

we take maybe a 10-30% cut of each sale.

++++++
landing page should have featured artists etc.
music recommendations based on taggings likes etc. friends likes, friends bands.
find a local would be a great feature, see local band who have an album promo out.


coffeescript needs to be precompiled into public/js/ with a rake task or similar.
mongodb local needs to be installed and setup !TOP PRI!
first thing that should be made after auth is functioning is the blog...so that work can be blogged
after that should focus on user account fleshing out.....band relationships to user
band "profiles" then should be next
then band relationship to an album
and then band relationship to "promo" and "promo" relationship to 1..n of that band's albums
once this is done. flesh out album -> songs
then storing mp3
playing mp3
